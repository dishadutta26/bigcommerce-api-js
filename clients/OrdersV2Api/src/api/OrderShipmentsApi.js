/**
 * Orders V2
 * `/orders`endpoints integrate with point-of-sale, shipping, distribution, and inventory-management systems.  ## Order The Order object contains a record of the purchase agreement between a shopper and a merchant. To learn more about creating orders, see [Orders API Guide](/api-docs/orders/orders-api-overview).  ### Currency Fields  * `currency_code` - the display currency used to present prices to the shopper on the storefront. * `currency_exchange_rate`: the exchange rate between the store's default currency and the display currency; when the order is created by means of the V2 endpoints, this value is always 1 (only in the storefront this value can be different to 1).  The following additional fields are returned on orders when Multi-Currency is enabled on the store:  * `store_default_currency_code` - the store's default currency * `store_default_to_transactional_exchange_rate` - the exchange rate between the store's default currency and the transactional currency used in the order.  **Example:**  ```json {   //...   \"currency_id\": 4,   \"currency_code\": \"EUR\",   \"currency_exchange_rate\": 1,   \"default_currency_id\": 4,   \"default_currency_code\": \"EUR\",   \"store_default_currency_code: \"USD\",   \"store_default_to_transactional_exchange_rate\": \"100.0000000000\"   //... }  ```  ## Order Coupons Coupon code applied to an order.  ## Order Messages Messages associated with an order.  ## Order Products Product line items belonging to an order.  ## Order Shipping Addresses Customer shipping address belonging to an order.  ## Order Statuses Each order status represents a state in the order-fulfillment workflow.  ## Order Taxes Each tax applied to an order. This information can be useful for reporting purposes. All values are read-only.  ## Order Shipments Tracks a package consignment from an order that is shipped from the seller to the buyer.  ## Order Shipping Addresses Quotes Read Only. Gets all shipping quotes from an order.
