/**
 * Orders V3
 * - [OAuth Scopes](#oauth-scopes) - [Authentication](#authentication) - [Available Endpoints](#available-endpoints) - [Order Transactions](#order-transactions) - [Resources](#resources)  The V3 REST API's Orders resource surfaces endpoints related to payment processing. The `/orders/{id}/transactions` endpoint returns transaction details for the specified order. To programmatically create, update, and delete orders themselves, see [Orders v2](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/store-management/orders). To process payments, see [Payment Processing](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/payments/payments-process-payments).  ## OAuth Scopes | UI Name| Permission |Parameter|                                      |----------------------------------------------|------------|-----------------------------------------------| | Order Transactions|modify|`store_v2_transactions`| | Order Transactions|read-only  |`store_v2_transactions_read_only`| | Orders| modify|`store_v2_orders`| | Orders| read-only|`store_v2_orders_read_only`|  For more information on OAuth Scopes, see: [Authentication](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/getting-started/authentication).  ## Authentication Requests can be authenticated by sending a `client_id` and `access_token` via `X-Auth-Client` and `X-Auth-Token` HTTP headers:  ```http GET /stores/{$$.env.store_hash}/v3/catalog/summary host: api.bigcommerce.com Accept: application/json X-Auth-Client: {client_id} X-Auth-Token: {access_token} ```  |Header|Parameter|Description| |-|-|-| |`X-Auth-Client`|`client_id`|Obtained by creating an API account or installing an app in a BigCommerce control panel.| |`X-Auth-Token`|`access_token `|Obtained by creating an API account or installing an app in a BigCommerce control panel.|  For more information on Authenticating BigCommerce APIs, see: [Authentication](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/getting-started/authentication).  ## Available Endpoints | Endpoint|Description|Reference |---|---|---| | `/orders/{id}/transactions`             | Get list of transaction data for an order|[Get Transactions](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/store-management/order-transactions/transactions/gettransactions) |`/orders/{id}/payment_actions/refund_quotes`|` POST` - Create refund quote for order ID `{id}`.|[Create a Refund Quote](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/store-management/order-transactions/order-refunds/postrefundquote) |`/orders/{id}/payment_actions/refunds`|`POST` Create a refund for order ID `{id}`.|[Create a Refund](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/store-management/order-transactions/order-refunds/postrefund) |`/orders/{id}/payment_actions/refunds`|` GET` - Returns the refunds for order ID `{id}`.|[Get Refunds For Order](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/store-management/order-transactions/order-refunds/getorderrefunds) |`/orders/payment_actions/refunds`|`GET` - Returns a list of refunds ordered by refund ID.|[Get All Refunds](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/store-management/order-transactions/order-refunds/getrefunds)  ## Order Transactions The `/orders/{id}/transactions` endpoint returns details about the payment instruments used to pay for an order. Depending on the payment method used, different details will be available. Not all credit card payment gateways return full card or fraud details. Transactions endpoints are primarily used to get detailed gateway response information for credit card transactions; however they will also return any available information about digital wallet and offline payments.   **Note**: transactions are not created for the following payment methods: * Test Payment Gateway * PayPal Express * Amazon Pay  ## Order Refunds The Order API refund endpoints allow developers to process refunds against orders with settled payments. Refund endpoints are useful when building order management or payment integrations. They make embedding refund functionality directly into the application possible without requiring merchants to return to their BigCommerce Control Panel.  ## Resources * [Orders Overview](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/orders/orders-overview) * [Orders V2](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/store-management/orders)
