 * Price Lists
 * - [OAuth Scopes](#oauth-scopes) - [Authentication](#authentication) - [Available Endpoints](#available-endpoints) - [Price List Assignment Order of Operations](#price-list-assignment-order-of-operations) - [Usage Notes](#usage-notes)  A Price List allows you to populate different versions of catalog pricing and assign them to different [Customer Groups](/api-reference/customer-subscribers/customers-api). The prices are specified exclusively at the variant level.   The association of a Price List to a Customer Group can be done either via the Control Panel or using the [Customer Groups API.](/api-reference/customer-subscribers/customers-api)  Additionally, [Price List Assignments](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/store-management/price-lists/price-lists-records/) can be created to assign Price Lists to a specific [Channel](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/cart-checkout/channels-listings-api). Price lists assigned to a channel apply to all shoppers on that channel, unless there is a more specific assignment.  If an active Price List does not contain prices for a variant then the Catalog pricing will be used. The association of a Price List to a Customer Group can be done either via the Control Panel or using the [Customer Groups API.](/api-reference/customer-subscribers/customers-api)  Price Lists will provide overridden price values to the Stencil storefront. Final price display can be further customized within the Stencil template. See the [Price Object](https://stencil.bigcommerce.com/docs/price-object-properties) in Stencil for further documentation.

For variants without `Price Records`, any existing product bulk pricing will apply. - Price Lists Records accepts bulk upsert. Only one [Bulk upsert](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/catalog/pricelists-api/price-lists-records/setpricelistrecordcollection) can done at a time. Running more than one in parallel on the **same store** will cause a 429 error and the request will fail.   ### Related Endpoints * [Get Price List Collection](/api-reference/catalog/pricelists-api/price-lists/getpricelistcollection)  ### Webhooks Available There are no direct webhooks available for Price Lists.
